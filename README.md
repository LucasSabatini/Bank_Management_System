# Bank_Management_System

### This is a https://favtutor.com website Java Project Challenge.

To start, the proposed system is a web-based project that allows you to do everything a bank would allow you to do naturally.

One should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as the user desires. There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdraws if the balance is sufficient. There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.

There will be several improvements to this project in the future, including the addition of support for various types of accounts. For example, there may be a recurring deposit account that should not allow withdrawals until the due date, and the amount is automatically added to the account after the due date.
